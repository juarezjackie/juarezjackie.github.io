   <h1> Excerpt from The Song of Achilles </h1>
   <h2> By Madeline Miller </h2>

  <div> <h4> "I listened and did not speak. Achilles' eyes were bright in the firelight, his face drawn sharply by the flickering shadows. I would know it in the dark or disguise, I told myself. I would know it even in madness" (Miller 84).</h4> </br> 
  </div> 
  <br> 
  <div> <h4> "We were like gods at the dawning of the world, and our joy was so bright we could see nothing else but the other" (Miller 103).</h4> </br>
