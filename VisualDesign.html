<h4> <p> 1. My original picture was a slice of pumpkin pie. I chose this image because I really like eating pumpkin pie during thanksgiving. 
The filters I chose at first were filters that gave the picture gradients. After being told I needed to change the picture so it looks 
nothing like my original picture I started to play with different filters. Along with playing around with the adjustments. 
The main adjustment I altered was the brightness because increasing the brightness would help hide the main subject on the picture. 
After playing with the filters and adjustments I went on to turn my image into a kaleidoscope. I then selected a piece of my picture and 
copied and pasted it into a background. The main element that helped turn my picture into a kaleidoscope was flipping my image horizontally and 
	vertically. I kept copying and pasting and flipping until my whole page was covered up. </h4> </p>

<img src = "JJ.Mandala1.jpg" alt = "mandala" width = "275" height = "260">
<h4> <p> 2. My original shape was a flower. I chose this shape because I thought it was pretty and because I like flowers. When it comes to choosing the 
different colors I wanted them to be vibrant colors so it can be very visible. Which is why I chose the colors blue, green, purple and red. To make 
my mandala I had to duplicate my original flowers and then rotate it 180 degrees. After this I would repeat those same steps except I would change my 
colors and only rotate my flowers 45 degrees. Then, after doing that 8 times I would rotate my design again and this time I would also size it down. I 
	kept doing this until I liked my final result. </h4> </p>

<img src = "jj.gradient.png" alt = "pop gradient" width = "340" height = "380"> 
<h4> <p> 3. Out of three of my pop art portraits I did, I decided to chose this one of Steve Lacy. Steve Lacy is a music artist, I really enjoy his music sometimes
I wish his songs were longer lol. But overall, I enjoy the vibe he gives off and his music is just nice to listen to. When it comes to color I decided to 
go more towards my greens and blues. I wanted the colors of each piece where close in color but not exactly the same color. Which is why the colors on my pop
art are very similar. I first adjusted the contrast to 100 and and my brightness to 20 just so the subject would be more clearer. Then I outlined the subject 
with a stroke so it seemed like it was traced around with marker so the subject sticks out. After that, I played around with my gradients I used a premade one
and then ended up adjusting it. I cut and copied and pasted my product so I can make it into four different pieces. Thats when I played around with the hue and
	saturation of each section. Overall, I really enjoyed making it and proud of how it came out. </h4> </p>
