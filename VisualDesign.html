<h5> My original picture was a slice of pumpkin pie. I chose this image because I really like eating pumpkin pie during thanksgiving. 
The filters I chose at first were filters that gave the picture gradients. After being told I needed to change the picture so it looks 
nothing like my original picture I started to play with different filters. Along with playing around with the adjustments. 
The main adjustment I altered was the brightness because increasing the brightness would help hide the main subject on the picture. 
After playing with the filters and adjustments I went on to turn my image into a kaleidoscope. I then selected a piece of my picture and 
copied and pasted it into a background. The main element that helped turn my picture into a kaleidoscope was flipping my image horizontally and 
	vertically. I kept copying and pasting and flipping until my whole page was covered up. </h5>
