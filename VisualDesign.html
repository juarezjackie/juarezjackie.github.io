<h4> <p> My original picture was a slice of pumpkin pie. I chose this image because I really like eating pumpkin pie during thanksgiving. 
The filters I chose at first were filters that gave the picture gradients. After being told I needed to change the picture so it looks 
nothing like my original picture I started to play with different filters. Along with playing around with the adjustments. 
The main adjustment I altered was the brightness because increasing the brightness would help hide the main subject on the picture. 
After playing with the filters and adjustments I went on to turn my image into a kaleidoscope. I then selected a piece of my picture and 
copied and pasted it into a background. The main element that helped turn my picture into a kaleidoscope was flipping my image horizontally and 
	vertically. I kept copying and pasting and flipping until my whole page was covered up. </h4> </p>

<h4> <p> My original shape was a flower. I chose this shape because I thought it was pretty and because I like flowers. When it comes to choosing the 
different colors I wanted them to be vibrant colors so it can be very visible. Which is why I chose the colors blue, green, purple and red. To make 
my mandala I had to duplicate my original flowers and then rotate it 180 degrees. After this I would repeat those same steps except I would change my 
colors and only rotate my flowers 45 degrees. Then, after doing that 8 times I would rotate my design again and this time I would also size it down. I 
	kept doing this until I liked my final result. </h4> </p>
