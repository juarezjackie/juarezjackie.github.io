<h4> <p> 1. My original picture was a slice of pumpkin pie. I chose this image because I really like eating pumpkin pie during thanksgiving. 
The filters I chose at first were filters that gave the picture gradients. After being told I needed to change the picture so it looks 
nothing like my original picture I started to play with different filters. Along with playing around with the adjustments. 
The main adjustment I altered was the brightness because increasing the brightness would help hide the main subject on the picture. 
After playing with the filters and adjustments I went on to turn my image into a kaleidoscope. I then selected a piece of my picture and 
copied and pasted it into a background. The main element that helped turn my picture into a kaleidoscope was flipping my image horizontally and 
	vertically. I kept copying and pasting and flipping until my whole page was covered up. </h4> </p>

<img src = "JJ.Mandala1.jpg" alt = "mandala" width = "275" height = "260">
<h4> <p> 2. My original shape was a flower. I chose this shape because I thought it was pretty and because I like flowers. When it comes to choosing the 
different colors I wanted them to be vibrant colors so it can be very visible. Which is why I chose the colors blue, green, purple and red. To make 
my mandala I had to duplicate my original flowers and then rotate it 180 degrees. After this I would repeat those same steps except I would change my 
colors and only rotate my flowers 45 degrees. Then, after doing that 8 times I would rotate my design again and this time I would also size it down. I 
	kept doing this until I liked my final result. </h4> </p>

<img src = "jj.gradient.png" alt = "pop gradient" width = "340" height = "380"> 
<h4> <p> 3. Out of three of my pop art portraits I did, I decided to chose this one of Steve Lacy. Steve Lacy is a music artist, I really enjoy his music sometimes
I wish his songs were longer lol. But overall, I enjoy the vibe he gives off and his music is just nice to listen to. When it comes to color I decided to 
go more towards my greens and blues. I wanted the colors of each piece where close in color but not exactly the same color. Which is why the colors on my pop
art are very similar. I first adjusted the contrast to 100 and and my brightness to 20 just so the subject would be more clearer. Then I outlined the subject 
with a stroke so it seemed like it was traced around with marker so the subject sticks out. After that, I played around with my gradients I used a premade one
and then ended up adjusting it. I cut and copied and pasted my product so I can make it into four different pieces. Thats when I played around with the hue and
	saturation of each section. Overall, I really enjoyed making it and proud of how it came out. </h4> </p>

<img src = "forest-5167332_1280.png" alt = "beast battle" width = "340" height = "294"> 
<h4> <p> When picking out my different animals to use I focused on what different aspects each animal had that made them strong or useful. For my first animal my three 
animals were a bear, a giraffe and a snake. I chose these animals with the intension of using the bears head because bears have sharp teeth. I used the giraffes body
because they have really long necks and they can bend their neck downwards to eat other people. For the snake I used the whole animal to make it a part of the animals tail 
because it looked like one and also because they can defend from the back. For my second creature I chose the animals elephant, tiger and a bat. I chose the elephant 
with the intention of using its body because even though elephants can be slow they are really hevy and can smash things easily. I chose the tiger because I wanted to 
use the head because it seemed more intimidating then the elephants. I just added the bat wings for fun because I thought it would add some comedic aspect. My first animal 
had the ability to see from far heights and the ability to bite people who attack them from the back. My second creature has the ability to fly and tumble over people 
who get in their way. With both creatures after I found the pictures I wanted to use on google I opened all three of them on photoshop. Then I outlined each of the pictures 
so I only had the animal and not the background it came in. After I did that I erased all the parts of the animal I didn't want to use for each animal body. After doing that 
I combined the parts to make my creature and fixed up the corner and edges. I then added a new file where I picked a background setting and then placed both od my creatures 
next to each other. </h4> </p>

<img src = "LOVE NOT BORDERS.png" alt = "activism poster" width = "300" height = "300"> 
<h4> <p> For this artwork, I made an activism poster. An activism poster is a way for someone to spread information and importance of a certain social topic. The topic I chose 
to highlight was immigrant rights and the separation of families. I first looked for one image I wanted to use, this was really important because that image would be the main 
element in my poster. After choosing my picture I played around with the way I wanted to present it, I ended up choosing a paint brush shape to change the shape of the picture.
I wanted the colors in my poster to coordinate a little so I chose colors I felt looked nice together. After that, I added a piece of text, with that piece of text I wanted to 
make a slogan that Iâ€™ve heard and that's really said in the movement. Overall, I kept the text and image simple but I made it so everyone who looked at it knew the message I was
getting across. </h4> </p>
