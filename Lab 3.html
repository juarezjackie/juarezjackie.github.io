<h2> Hi, 
  welcome to my website
<h3> This is my website that introduces various different types of music and music genres. 
<br>
This is an FYI that this website contains music from my personal taste.
<br>
 This was a fun way for me to share the music I listen to and to some of my favorites lately. </h3>


<h3> I tried to fit in as many genres as I could there is so many I just went of my personal taste. 
<br>
You can listen to these songs on platforms like  Spotify, Apple Music, and etc.</h3>
